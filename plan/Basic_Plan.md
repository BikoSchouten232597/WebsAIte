I want to make an AI/Algorithm based program that uses img/pattern recognition within an image to detect different types of HTML Sections and converts the image to an HTML Structure. I'm not sure yet if I want to use a complex set of algorithmâ€™s or an neural network for detecting different patterns.

Possibility one:

1.	Take img
2.	Convert to byte arr
3.	Let neural network detect pattern
4.	Remove value of pattern
5.	Save to order of patterns
6.	Go back to 3 unless no pattern found
7.	Grab html code and make structure

Possibility two:
1.	Have pics of patterns in folder
2.	Let algorithm check for said patterns
3.	Save to order of patterns
4.	Grab html code an make structure
